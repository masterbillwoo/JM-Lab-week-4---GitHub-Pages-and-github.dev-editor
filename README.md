[CLI commands](docs/cli.md)

## Keyboard shortcuts
Shortcuts I frequently use: 
- Ctrl-C (copy)
- Ctrl-V (paste)
- Ctrl-Z (undo)
- Ctrl-backspace
- Ctrl-A(all)
- Ctrl-F(search)
- Ctrl-Alt-Delete(logout)


Shortcuts I would like to start using: 
- Win-A (actions)
- Win-I (settings)
- Win-D (show desktop)
- Super-Hyper-Meta-F (I donâ€™t even have such keys, but it sounds impressive)
